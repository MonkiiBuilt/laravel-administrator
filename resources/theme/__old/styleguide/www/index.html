<!-- 
	Styleguide index
	==================================
	Each component has its own styleguide .html file with its own navigation so 
	there is no homepage or master template. This script simply redirects to a 
	component to begin the users journey, usually redirects to the buttons 
	component as its first in the list. 

	If you need the styleguide to show a particular component when it opens, you
	can set this here.
